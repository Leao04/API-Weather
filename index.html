            <h2 id="h2" class="h2">Do you know what is the rain?</h2>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">Clouds are made of water droplets. Within a cloud, water droplets condense onto
                one another, causing the droplets to grow. When these water droplets get too heavy to stay suspended in
                the cloud, they fall to Earth as rain.</p>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">Come to think of it, what makes it snow, hail, and sleet? All these forms of water
                don’t fall out of a
                clear, blue sky. You need clouds. But what makes clouds?Clouds form from water or ice that has
                evaporated from Earth’s surface, or from plants that give off water and oxygen as a product of
                photosynthesis. When it evaporates—that is, rises from Earth’s surface into the atmosphere—water is in
                the form of a gas, water vapor. Water vapor turns into clouds when it cools and condenses—that is, turns
                back into liquid water or ice. In order to condense, the water vapor must have a solid to glom onto.
                This solid “seed” may be a speck of dust or pollen, or a drop of water or crystal of ice. Dew is water
                vapor that has condensed back onto Earth’s surface—on grass or a car’s windshield, for example.</p>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">In the cloud, with more water condensing onto other water droplets, the droplets
                grow. When they get too
                heavy to stay suspended in the cloud, even with updrafts within the cloud, they fall to Earth as rain.
                If the air in the cloud is below the freezing point (32 °F or 0 °C), ice crystals form; if the air all
                the way down to the ground is also freezing or below, you get snow. However, if the layers of atmosphere
                within the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground, alternate between warmer than freezing and
                colder than freezing, you get other kinds of precipitation.</p>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">For example, if a snowflake falls through a warmer part of the cloud it can get
                coated with water, then
                frozen again as it’s tossed back into a colder part. It can go round and round, adding more and more
                layers of new ice. When it’s too heavy to stay up, what finally comes down is hail. If the updrafts in a
                thunder cloud are strong enough, the hail stones can get pretty big before they become too heavy to stay
                up. Hail stones can range from pea size to golf ball size, and up! A new record for the largest
                hailstone ever was set in 2010! It fell on July 23, in Vivian, South Dakota. It was 8 inches in
                diameter, 18.62 inches in circumference, and weighed 1.93 pounds. That could put a real dent in your
                day!</p>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">Hail can cause a lot of damage to buildings, cars, and especially crops. However,
                freezing rain can be
                even worse. Freezing rain occurs when the conditions are just "right." Falling snow encounters, first a
                layer of warmer air, which melts the snowflakes, and then, just above the surface of Earth, a very cold
                layer, which makes the liquid water “super-cooled,” ready to freeze up at the slightest hint of
                encouragement. Now, when the super-cooled rain hits colder-than-freezing ground and objects near the
                ground (such as roads, trees, and power lines)—snap! Just like that, the about-to-freeze rain turns to
                ice. The ice coats everything with a thin, sometimes transparent, frozen film. As more rain falls, the
                coating becomes thicker. The ice can become so thick and heavy that tree limbs snap and fall across
                power lines, or the power lines themselves just sag and sag until they snap.</p>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">Clouds are the key element of the water cycle, since they are the transporters
                that move water from one
                place on Earth to another. They are also important in determining how much of the Sun’s energy is
                absorbed and trapped in the atmosphere. They are thus very important in altering the temperature of the
                air and Earth’s surface. The warmer the air, the more water it can hold. The warmer the oceans, the
                faster water evaporates from them. Surface winds also increase evaporation. (Notice that after a
                rainstorm, the road dries faster if it is windy.) And the more water in the air, the more the sun’s
                energy is trapped, making things still warmer.</p>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">Satellites are important tools for atmospheric scientists and weather forecasters.
                Current weather
                satellites give scientists information about how clouds look from the top, and even how high they are.
                Scientists use data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) series
                satellites, along with data from NASA's Global Precipitation Mission, to study precipitation, rainfall
                and hurricanes.</p>
            <p class="sentenceClass3">Together, these satellites provide images and other data about the atmosphere that enable meteorologists
                (who study short-term weather) and climatologists (who study long-term climate change) to study Earth
                water cycle. It is the job of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to build and
                launch (with NASA’s help) and to operate two different types of environmental satellites.</p>
